The game is: You are david (looks like '^'), and you need to reach your sheep ('*').
			 You move in a world full of:
			 	1. walls ("|", "-")
			 	2. trees
			 	3. bushes
			 	4. monsters
			 	5. ...
			 which you cant touch. If you touch them - you will die, and the game will reset.
			 you move with the arrow keys (↑→↓←).

			 # Ver 1: This version will support the following capabillties:
			 	#1 Creates a board
			 	#2 Creates an animation
			 	#3 Moves the animation by random directions
			 	#4 The animation will recognize obstacles


board
	properties:
		# board_limits - a tuple containing the max height and width of the board.
		# all_board_elements - a list contains all board elemets (elements ids).
		# board_elements_types - a dict of all elements types. the key will be the name, and the value wil be a hex value.
		# board_index - a number which holds the current index of all elements.


	objects:
		# pos - a simple object which suppose to hold the position of board elements.
		  		a position is the coordinates of an element.
		  		the position needs to be in board limits.
		  		the pos object must define:
		  			properties:
		  				# element_X_pos
		  				# element_Y_pos
		  			methods:
		  				# _validate_coordinates - a function which validates the received coordinates (using board_limits).

		# direction - a simple object which suppose to hold the direction of board elements.
					  An direction is the diff between the current position of an element and its next pos.
					  The direction object must define:
					  	# element_X_diff
					  	# element_Y_diff

		# board_element - a generic object in the board. Its the most basic form of the element,
						  the generic object must define:
						  		properties:
						  			# __id - an internal property which is the core id of the element.
						  					 the core id of an element will be a hash of __type and __index.  
						  			# __type - the type of the element
						  			# __index - the index of the element (given at creation)
						  			# board_element_repr - a character which represents the element.
									# board_element_pos - a pos object, represents the position of the element.

		# board_animation - a board element which can move and can be user-controlled/independent.
						  	the board element must define:
						  		properties:
									# board_element_direction - a direction object, represents the direction of the element.
						  		methods:
									# move - a function which receives a direction object and move 
							  				 the animation in the direction. 
							  				 It will:
							  				 	#1 Calculates the next pos
							  				 	#2 Tests if the next pos is possible
							  				 	#3 Clears the previous pos
							  				 	#4 Prints the new pos
									# _is_on_board_element - a function which checks if the animation on a board element.
									# _clear_animation - a function which clears the animation from the board.
									# _print_animation - a function which prints the new location of the animation.

	methods:
		# clear_screen - a function which clears the console.
		# finish_game - a function which finishes the game.
		# create_board - a function which creates all board elements. 
		# print_board - a function which prints all board elements.
